In the Self Driving Car project, he was responsible for the application side of the project. He had to make the swarm to be flexible and fast and work together dynamically.

To achieve that, he selected to use Docker Swarm, for the clustering, to make simple APIs with NodeJS and Python with the use of Express and Flask and to present the data in a web interface with VueJS.

He was also responsible to make the virtual Network inside Docker Swarm safe to use and free of any attacks.
